# react-native-app
You'll need Node.js (v10 or newer) installed, so if you don't have it already, download the installer at nodejs.org(https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Choose the appropriate package for your platform and follow the instructions to install.
If you do not have git then install git in your system from the url.(https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Installation
First, let's install expo-cli. expo-cli is a command-line tool for easily starting a new React Native project.

    npm install -g expo-cli

Now use git to clone the project into your local directory and run the project:

    git clone https://github.com/srujithch/react-native-app.git 
    cd react-native-app
    npm start

expo-cli might take a few minutes to download dependencies. You should see a QR code after it's done.

Now you can install the Expo Client on iOS or Android and scan the QR code to view it.
